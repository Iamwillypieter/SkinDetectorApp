    <string name="desc_bcc">It is the most common type of skin cancer that develops in the basal cells of the skin. It usually appears as a small, shiny bump or a pinkish patch on the skin, and it can grow slowly over time. It is commonly found on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun.</string>
    <string name="desc_df">It is a benign skin growth that usually appears as a firm, round bump on the skin. It is typically brown or reddish-brown in color and can be caused by injury or irritation to the skin. It is usually harmless but can be removed if it becomes bothersome.</string>
    <string name="desc_scc">It is a type of skin cancer that develops in the squamous cells of the skin. It typically appears as a red, scaly patch or a wart-like bump on the skin. It can grow quickly and can spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.</string>
